Cotype is a simple web page where you can train your typing skills on a real texts, you can both train main writing skills by typing the news 
or practice in code typing

The idea is mostly to have a simple functionality with highlighting the symbol you are typing and show you the stats. You have two options:
1. Type a predifened page of the news or of the code (you have a UI buttons to swith between modes)
2. You can paste a url with text or with a github page and the text will appear automatically to type (in news mode it will be just text, in 
code mode it is only a github link to a file)

Each text is limited, after typing all the text you can check the stats (such as words per minuite, how long did it take to write, and 
problematic keys), stats will appear in a section after the text
also you have extra mode where a random words generated with problematic keys and you can type them as practice (after completing an extra, 
you can either return to main section or take the extra again (it generates again))
extra looks like regular section of typing


I want an app written with TailwindCSS v4 and supplied with github pages with an auto CI CD like github actions so after push the page is 
updated, if you decide to use framework use SolidJS or you can simply use lightweight js frameworks like alpine js and stick to the HTML JS 
approach (pich only one either Solid or HTML/JS)

I want this web app to have a tokyo night theme and highlighting, the animations should be smooth, if one or more characters are misspelled it 
should highlight them red until the user "delete" them, the text is not changing it only highlights what you have mistyped, the character 
which should be typed next should be typed next, should be highlighted green, text that is not yet been typed should be a color of comment and 
after typed should have syntax highlight applied
